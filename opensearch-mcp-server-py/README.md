## OpenSearch MCP Server
**opensearch-mcp-server-py** is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for OpenSearch that enables AI assistants to interact with OpenSearch clusters. It provides a standardized interface for AI models to perform operations like searching indices, retrieving mappings, and managing shards through both stdio and Server-Sent Events (SSE) protocols.

**Key features:**
- Seamless integration with AI assistants and LLMs through the MCP protocol
- Support for both stdio and SSE server transports
- Built-in tools for common OpenSearch operations
- Easy integration with Claude Desktop and LangChain
- Secure authentication using basic auth or IAM roles

## Installing opensearch-mcp-server-py
Opensearch-mcp-server-py can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/opensearch-mcp-server-py/) via pip:
```
pip install opensearch-mcp-server-py
```
