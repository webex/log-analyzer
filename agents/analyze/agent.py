Analyze Agent v2 — Batch-mode analysis agents for the incremental map-reduce pipeline.

Invoked programmatically via ADK Runner from incremental.py's run_analysis_consumer().
Each invocation receives ONE batch of condensed log entries (via user message) plus a
prior compact memory summary, and outputs structured JSON for the reduce() step.

Keeps the original calling_agent / contact_center_agent split with full instructions,
skills, and cross-service correlation guidance. Only the output format changed from
markdown to structured JSON, and log sources come from the batch message instead of
session state variables.

Skill toolsets (mobius, architecture, sip_flow) are also exported for use by chat_agent.

**Batch Analysis Context (from exhaustive BFS search):**
You will receive ONE BATCH of condensed log entries from a Webex Calling / Contact Center \
platform, along with a PRIOR ANALYSIS SUMMARY from earlier batches (compact memory).

These logs were collected by an exhaustive graph-traversal search agent that:
- Started from user-provided identifiers and searched OpenSearch indexes
- Extracted ALL related IDs (session IDs, call IDs, tracking IDs, etc.)
- Recursively searched for those IDs across multiple indexes and services
- Ran searches in parallel for speed

This means the batch may contain logs spanning MULTIPLE call legs, forwarded sessions,
retries, or related interactions that a single-ID search would have missed.

**IMPORTANT: You must analyze EVERY log entry in this batch. Do NOT skip or summarize \
groups of logs. Read each log line, extract its meaning, and incorporate it into the analysis.
If there is a prior analysis summary, build upon it — focus on what is NEW in this batch.**
"""

_ANALYSIS_POINTS = """
**Be THOROUGH and EXHAUSTIVE in your analysis. This is critical debugging information.**

Your analysis MUST cover ALL of the following in full detail:

1. **Complete HTTP request/response communication** (list EVERY request you find)
    - Capture EVERY HTTP request and response pair chronologically
    - For each: exact timestamp, source → destination, method, full path, status code
    - Include relevant headers (Content-Type, Authorization scheme, X-headers)
    - Note payload details when available (body size, key fields)
    - Print ALL relevant IDs: device ID, user ID, call ID, meeting ID, tracking ID, session ID, correlation ID
    - Flag any non-2xx responses with emphasis
    - Note request duration / latency if available

2. **End-to-end SIP Communication** (reconstruct the FULL SIP dialog)
    - Map the COMPLETE SIP message flow: every INVITE, 100 Trying, 180 Ringing, 183 Session Progress, 200 OK, ACK, UPDATE, re-INVITE, BYE, CANCEL, PRACK
    - For each SIP message: timestamp, source → destination, method/response code, Call-ID, CSeq, branch
    - Extract SDP details: media lines (m=), codec (a=rtpmap), ICE candidates, DTLS fingerprint
    - Track SIP dialog state transitions
    - Correlate SIP Call-IDs across Mobius (wxm-app logs) and SSE/MSE (wxcalling logs) — these are the SAME call seen from different services
    - Note any SIP error responses (4xx, 5xx, 6xx) with reason phrases
    - Identify retransmissions, timeouts, or missing ACKs

3. **Media Path Analysis** (if media-related logs are present)
    - ICE candidate gathering and connectivity checks
    - DTLS-SRTP handshake status
    - RTP/RTCP flow establishment
    - Media quality indicators if available (jitter, packet loss, MOS)
    - TURN/STUN server interactions

4. **Timing Analysis**
    - Calculate time deltas between key events (e.g., INVITE to 200 OK = call setup time)
    - Identify any unusual delays (>2s between expected sequential events)
    - Note the total call duration if BYE is present
    - Flag any timeouts

5. **Error Detection and Root Cause Analysis** (be SPECIFIC and ACTIONABLE)
    - Identify EVERY error event, warning, or anomaly in the logs
    - For each error:
        - Exact timestamp and source service
        - Error code / HTTP status / SIP response code
        - Full error message text
        - What was happening when the error occurred (context)
        - Root cause analysis: WHY did this happen?
        - Step-by-step fix / remediation
        - Escalation path if not self-serviceable
    - Look for subtle issues: retries, fallbacks, degraded paths that succeeded but indicate problems

6. **Cross-Service Correlation**
    - Since logs come from multiple services (Mobius, SSE, MSE, WxCAS), explicitly correlate events across services using shared IDs
    - Identify any gaps: e.g., Mobius sent INVITE but no corresponding log from SSE = potential routing issue
    - Track the same transaction across service boundaries

Use the **sip_flow_skill** for SIP message sequences, response code meanings, SDP negotiation details, SIP timers, and common failure patterns (see references/sip_flows.md).
Use the **mobius_error_id_skill** when you encounter mobius-error codes or unexpected HTTP status codes from Mobius.

1. **Mobius logs** (logstash-wxm-app indexes, tags: mobius) — HTTP/WebSocket signaling, SIP translation, device registration
2. **SSE/MSE logs** (logstash-wxcalling indexes, tags: sse, mse) — SIP edge signaling, media relay
3. **WxCAS logs** (logstash-wxcalling indexes, tags: wxcas) — Call routing, destination resolution, application server logic
4. **SDK/Client logs** (uploaded by user) — Client-side SDK perspective (browser/app WebRTC logs)

When SDK/Client logs are present, these provide the browser/app perspective. Correlate with server-side logs when both are available.

**Cross-source correlation is CRITICAL:**
- The SAME call appears in multiple log sources with different perspectives
- Correlate using shared IDs: Call-ID, Session ID, Tracking ID
- Mobius logs show the browser↔server HTTP side
- SSE logs show the SIP signaling side of the same events
- WxCAS logs show routing decisions
- SDK logs show the client-side WebRTC/SDK perspective
- Present a UNIFIED view that stitches together all perspectives

Because the search was exhaustive (BFS), you may see logs from MULTIPLE call legs,
forwarded sessions, or related interactions. Identify and correlate ALL of them.
